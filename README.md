## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **defense-in-depth AI security system** designed to protect applications from modern threats such as:

- Prompt injection attacks  
- Sensitive data (PII) exposure  
- Behavioral anomalies  
- Brute-force login attempts  
- Insider threats  

It combines **frontend and backend protections** to ensure sensitive data is sanitized before and after transmission, while continuously analyzing user behavior for real-time threat detection.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🔐 Multi-Layer Security Architecture

- Authentication validation  
- Rate limiting enforcement  
- Prompt injection detection  
- PII sanitization (client + server)  
- Behavioral threat scoring  
- Secure logging  

---

### 🧾 PII Protection (Defense-in-Depth)

| Layer | Description |
|------|------------|
| Frontend | Masks PII before sending request |
| Backend | Re-validates and sanitizes input |
| Logging | Prevents raw PII exposure |

**Detected PII:**
- Emails → `[EMAIL]`  
- Phone numbers → `[PHONE]`  
- Date of Birth → `[DOB]`  

---
### 🧠 Behavioral Threat Detection

The system evaluates user activity using:

- Failed login patterns  
- IP address anomalies  
- After-hours access  
- Sensitive endpoint usage  
- High-risk actions (e.g., data export, privilege escalation)  

#### 🚨 Threat Levels
- Low  
- Medium  
- High  
- Critical  

#### 🔒 Automated Actions
- Account lockout  
- IP blacklisting  
- Request blocking (403)  

---

## 🚨 Example Detection Scenarios

| Scenario | Outcome |
|--------|--------|
| Multiple failed logins | Flagged |
| Failed + successful login | High risk |
| Sensitive endpoint + export | Blocked |
| Repeated attacks | IP blacklisted |

## 🧪 Testing

### 🔴 Failed Login Simulation
{
"user": "attacker",
"token": "anyvalue",
"prompt": "Testing failed login",
"ip": "192.168.1.50",
"action": "login",
"status": "failed",
"endpoint": "/login"
}


Repeat 5 times → triggers:
- Account lockout  
- IP blacklist  
- Request blocking  

---

### 🔴 High-Risk Behavior
{
"user": "insider_user",
"token": "anyvalue",
"prompt": "Export all user records",
"ip": "192.168.1.88",
"action": "data_export",
"status": "success",
"endpoint": "/api/export"
}


---

## 📊 Measurable Impact

- Prevented raw PII exposure using dual-layer sanitization (frontend + backend)  
- Detected and blocked brute-force login attacks after 5 failed attempts  
- Implemented behavioral threat scoring with automated blocking  
- Reduced prompt injection risk using input validation  

---

## 🔒 Security Design Principles

- Defense-in-depth  
- Least privilege access  
- Input validation & sanitization  
- Behavioral analytics  
- Zero trust mindset  

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

Modern AI systems are vulnerable to prompt injection, data leakage, and behavioral attacks.  
This project demonstrates how traditional cybersecurity principles can be combined with AI-aware controls to secure intelligent systems.
